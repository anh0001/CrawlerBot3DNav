# Setting Up RealVNC Server on a Remote Ubuntu Machine

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a RealVNC server on a remote Ubuntu machine without a physical monitor. This is achieved by configuring a virtual display. 

## Step 1: Install RealVNC Server

First, we need to install the RealVNC server on the Ubuntu machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the RealVNC server package:**
    Use the `wget` command to download the package.
    ```bash
    wget https://www.realvnc.com/download/file/vnc.files/VNC-Server-6.7.2-Linux-x64.deb
    ```
    Note: Replace the URL with the latest version if necessary.

2. **Install the downloaded package:**
    Use the `dpkg` command to install the package.
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i VNC-Server-6.7.2-Linux-x64.deb
    ```

3. **Fix any dependency issues:**
    If there are any dependency issues, use the `apt-get install -f` command to fix them.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```

## Step 2: Configure a Virtual Display

Next, we need to configure a virtual display. Here's how:

1. **Create a new xorg configuration file:**
    Use the `nano` command to create a new configuration file.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    ```

2. **Add the following configuration to create a virtual display:**
    Copy and paste the following configuration into the file to create a virtual display.
    ```plaintext
    Section "Device"
         Identifier  "Configured Video Device"
         Driver      "dummy"
    EndSection

    Section "Monitor"
         Identifier  "Configured Monitor"
         HorizSync   31.5-48.5
         VertRefresh 50-70
    EndSection

    Section "Screen"
         Identifier  "Default Screen"
         Monitor     "Configured Monitor"
         Device      "Configured Video Device"
         DefaultDepth 24
         SubSection "Display"
              Depth 24
              Modes "1280x1024"
         EndSubSection
    EndSection
    ```

3. **Save and close the file.**

## Step 3: Start the VNC Server

Now, we can start the VNC server with the virtual display:

1. **Start the VNC server with the virtual display:**
    Use the `systemctl start` command to start the server.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start vncserver-x11-serviced.service
    ```

2. **Enable the VNC server to start on boot:**
    Use the `systemctl enable` command to ensure the server starts on boot.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable vncserver-x11-serviced.service
    ```

## Step 4: Connect to the VNC Server

Finally, we can connect to the VNC server:

1. **Retrieve the IP address of the Ubuntu machine:**
    Use the `ifconfig` command to find the IP address of the machine.
    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```

2. **Use a VNC viewer (e.g., RealVNC Viewer) to connect to the IP address.**

By following these steps, you should be able to set up the RealVNC server on a remote Ubuntu machine without needing a physical monitor. The virtual display configuration ensures that the desktop environment is accessible remotely.
